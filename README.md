# Public-Safety.Cloud - Public-API

We offer a public API to everyone. This API requires a bearer authentication token, which can be created in our customer
portal (https://portal.public-safety.cloud).  

## Current Version - FRAFT

### Contribute

If you want to contribute to our api, just create a pull-request or send us a message to info@kirch-solutions.de

### What will you find here?

You will find our API definitions and endpoints how you can communicate with our system. 
We will provide a test system too, 
which can be used to test your api calls in your local development setup or in a test or staging environment.

## REST-API
We will provide our API as an REST-API which only understands JSON, no XML ;)

## GRAPHQL-API
We will offer our API as GRAPHQL too, but only in a later release.
